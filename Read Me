#Problem Statement:

AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in the hospitality industry, is facing a decline in market share and revenue within the luxury/business hotels category due to strategic competition and ineffective decision-making. To address this challenge, the managing director has identified the need to leverage "Business and Data Intelligence" by incorporating insights derived from historical data.

Currently lacking an in-house data analytics team, the revenue management team has decided to engage a 3rd party service provider for data analytics. The primary objective is to regain market share and revenue through strategic decision-making informed by data-driven insights.

#Outcomes:

A comprehensive set of metrics tailored to the hospitality industry, focusing on revenue management and market share.
An interactive and visually appealing dashboard that aligns with stakeholder expectations.
Additional insights derived from the historical data that go beyond the initial metric list and mock-up dashboard.
A refined problem statement highlighting specific challenges and areas for strategic improvement.
